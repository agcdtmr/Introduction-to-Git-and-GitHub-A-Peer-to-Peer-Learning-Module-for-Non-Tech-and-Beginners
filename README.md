# Introduction to Git, GitHub and README.md: A Peer-to-Peer Learning Module for Non-Tech and Beginners

Peer-to-Peer Learning:

	‚Ä¢	Peer-to-peer learning is an educational approach where individuals learn from and with each other.
	‚Ä¢	Typically occurs in a non-hierarchical and informal setting.
	‚Ä¢	Participants share knowledge, ideas, and skills, reinforcing their learning by teaching others.
	‚Ä¢	This approach creates a collaborative environment, making it easier to explain concepts in simpler terms.
	‚Ä¢	Learners can ask questions and receive feedback from their peers.
	‚Ä¢	Makes the learning process dynamic and interactive.

What is Peer-to-Peer Learning?

Peer-to-peer learning is an educational approach where learners teach and learn from each other without relying solely on an instructor. It fosters collaboration, shared knowledge, and hands-on problem-solving. Benefits include:
	‚Ä¢	Active engagement
	‚Ä¢	Building confidence in explaining concepts
	‚Ä¢	Practical and interactive learning

Git and GitHub for non-technical users, beginners, learners with no prior coding or technical knowledge

This module will introduce the concepts of Git and GitHub in a simple and interactive way, especially for individuals with no technical background. We‚Äôll use peer-to-peer learning techniques to help learners understand these concepts and practices.

Module Overview
	‚Ä¢	Duration: 1-2 hours
	‚Ä¢	Target Audience: Non-technical users, beginners, learners with no prior coding or technical knowledge
	‚Ä¢	Learning Style: Peer-to-peer learning, group activities, discussion-based

Section 1: What is Git and GitHub?

1.1 What is Git?

Git is a tool used by people to track changes to files, especially when working on collaborative projects. Imagine you‚Äôre working on a report with a group, and everyone edits the same document at different times. Git helps you keep track of who made what changes and ensures that everyone‚Äôs changes are merged together properly.

1.2 What is GitHub?

GitHub is like a social network for developers but for projects. It hosts your Git repositories (files and their history) online, allowing others to see your work, contribute to it, and collaborate easily. It‚Äôs a website where people can store and share their projects with others.

Activity: Peer Discussion
	‚Ä¢	Break into pairs or small groups.
	‚Ä¢	Discuss: ‚ÄúIf you worked with a friend on a group project, how would you keep track of your changes to a shared document or task?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Share your thoughts with the larger group.

‚∏ª

Section 2: Setting Up Git and GitHub

2.1 Creating a GitHub Account
	‚Ä¢	Visit GitHub and sign up for an account.
	‚Ä¢	Set up your profile by adding a picture and a bio to make your profile look professional and personable.
	‚Ä¢	Interactive Task: Each learner should create their GitHub account and fill out their profile information.

2.2 Creating Your First Repository on GitHub
	‚Ä¢	A repository (repo) is where your project files live. It‚Äôs like a folder for your work.
	‚Ä¢	Steps:
	1.	On GitHub, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù button at the top-right corner.
	2.	Select ‚ÄúNew Repository‚Äù.
	3.	Name your repository and choose the option for a public or private project.
	4.	Click ‚ÄúCreate Repository.‚Äù

Activity: Peer-to-Peer Support
	‚Ä¢	In pairs, guide each other through the process of creating a GitHub repository.

Section 3: Git Basics

3.1 Git Commands ‚Äì The Basics

üîß Hands-On Task:
- Install Git (if not installed)
- Set up Git on your computer:
`
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
`


Even if you‚Äôre not a coder, you can understand some basic commands that Git uses to track changes.
	‚Ä¢	git init: This starts a new Git project.
	‚Ä¢	git add: Adds your changes to the list of things that should be tracked.
	‚Ä¢	git commit: Saves your changes to the project.
	‚Ä¢	git push: Sends your changes to GitHub.

Interactive Task:
In groups of three, each person will:
	1.	Start a simple project on their own local computer (e.g., a text document or an image).
	2.	Use the commands above to:
	‚Ä¢	Add the project files to Git.
	‚Ä¢	Commit the changes.
	‚Ä¢	Push it to GitHub.

Peer-to-peer discussion:
	‚Ä¢	Discuss: ‚ÄúWhat happens if multiple people are working on the same project at the same time?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Share thoughts and strategies for collaboration.

‚∏ª

Section 4: Collaboration on GitHub

4.1 Forking and Cloning
	‚Ä¢	Fork: This means creating your own copy of someone else‚Äôs project.
	‚Ä¢	Clone: Copying a project from GitHub to your local computer.

Activity: Group Challenge
	1.	Fork a public project on GitHub.
	2.	Clone it to your local machine.
	3.	Make a small change to the project, like editing a document or changing text in a file.
	4.	Push your changes back to your GitHub repo.

‚∏ª

Section 5: Pull Requests ‚Äì Working Together

5.1 What is a Pull Request?
	‚Ä¢	Pull Request (PR): A way to suggest changes to someone else‚Äôs project. When you submit a pull request, you‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made some changes; would you like to review and merge them into your project?‚Äù

Activity:
	‚Ä¢	In groups of 4, one person will create a small project, another person will fork it, and a third person will make a change and submit a pull request.
	‚Ä¢	The group will review the pull request and discuss whether to accept it or suggest changes.

‚∏ª

Section 6: Best Practices in Collaboration

6.1 How to Collaborate Effectively on GitHub
	‚Ä¢	Clear Communication: Always add descriptive commit messages like ‚ÄúFixed typo in readme file.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Be Open to Feedback: Review others‚Äô pull requests, leave comments, and suggest improvements.
	‚Ä¢	Respect Others‚Äô Work: Always ask for permission before changing someone‚Äôs project, and respect their code of conduct.

Activity: Group Discussion
	‚Ä¢	Discuss the challenges of collaborating in a peer-to-peer learning environment, and come up with strategies to manage conflicts, feedback, and merging.

‚∏ª

 Summary and Wrap-up
	‚Ä¢	Recap: Key takeaways about Git, GitHub, and the collaborative process.
	‚Ä¢	Q&A: Allow learners to ask questions or share any doubts about using Git and GitHub.

Section 7: README.md and GitHub Profile Enhancement (40 min)

üí° Activity: Group Collaboration ‚Äì Improve GitHub profiles with a README.md
	‚Ä¢	What is a README.md? (A markdown file that describes your project)
	‚Ä¢	Basic Markdown Syntax (Headings, Lists, Links, Images)
	‚Ä¢	How to create a profile README (github.com/yourusername/yourusername)

üîß Hands-On Task:
	1.	Create a profile repository on GitHub (yourusername/yourusername)
	2.	Add a README.md with:
	‚Ä¢	Introduction
	‚Ä¢	Skills/Projects
	‚Ä¢	Contact Info
	‚Ä¢	Fun facts (GIFs, Emojis, Badges)
	3.	Push changes and check your improved profile


Outcome & Reflection

‚úÖ You now have a GitHub profile README! üéâ
‚úÖ You‚Äôve collaborated and used Git/GitHub for version control
‚úÖ You can teach someone else these basics

üí° Final Activity: Pair-Review ‚Äì Provide feedback on each other‚Äôs profiles

Post-Module Activities
	‚Ä¢	Exercise: Encourage learners to apply their new knowledge by forking an interesting project on GitHub, making changes, and submitting a pull request.
	‚Ä¢	Peer Feedback: Organize a session where learners can review each other‚Äôs repositories, provide constructive feedback, and celebrate achievements.

This module is designed to be interactive, with a strong focus on peer-to-peer learning, where participants can guide and learn from each other while exploring the world of Git and GitHub.
